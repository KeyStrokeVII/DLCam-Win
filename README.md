# Manual Installation for Windows with GPU ONLY!!!

Please be aware that the installation requires technical skills and is not for beginners. Consider downloading the prebuilt version.

## Installation

This setup is specifically for systems with a GPU and will utilize GPU acceleration.

### 1. Set up Your Platform

- Python (3.10 recommended)
- Anaconda or Miniconda
- pip
- git
- ffmpeg - `iex (irm ffmpeg.tc.ht)`
- Visual Studio 2022 Runtimes (Windows)

### 2. Create and Activate Conda Environment

```bash
conda create --name your_env_name python=3.10
conda activate your_env_name
```

### 3. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KeyStrokeVII/DLCam-Win.git
cd DLCam-Win
```

### 4. Download the Models

- GFPGANv1.4
- inswapper_128_fp16.onnx

Place these files in the "models" folder.

### 5. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## GPU Acceleration

### CUDA Execution Provider (Nvidia)

- **Install For CUDA Toolkit 12.1.1**
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu
pip install onnxruntime-gpu==1.16.3
```

- **Usage:**

```bash
python run.py --execution-provider cuda
```

## To run the application using a batch file, follow these steps

### Prerequisites

 **Add Conda to PATH**: Add the `condabin` directory from your Conda installation to your system's PATH environment variable. Typically, it looks like `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\miniconda3\condabin`.

### Batch File Setup

Edit a batch file (e.g., `run-cuda.bat`) with the following content:

```batch
@echo off
REM Use the full path to activate Conda
call C:\Users\<YourUsername>\miniconda3\condabin\conda.bat activate your_env_name

REM Run the Python script with CUDA
python run.py --execution-provider cuda

REM Pause to keep the window open
pause
```

### Instructions

1. **Replace `<YourUsername>`**: Substitute with your actual Windows username.
2. **Replace `your_env_name`**: Substitute with the name of your Conda environment.
3. **Verify Execution Provider**: Ensure `cuda` is a valid option for the `--execution-provider` argument in `run.py`.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors related to the execution provider, check the script's documentation for valid options.
